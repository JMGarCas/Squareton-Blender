# Squareton Blender

This is a group project I did for the subject Graphic Modeling and Visualization, it consisted on using Blender to create an animation. Everything you see was created from scratch, no external model has been used in the creation of this animation.

I am going to display here only the models I, @JMGarCas, had worked on. 

## Final Result

[This is the final result](https://github.com/JMGarCas/Squareton-Blender/assets/73229121/4d42792b-cac6-4a66-9780-ce5b3287a570). To avoid any copyright issues, I have decided to mute all sounds.
